This whole system is not fully develop because I was not able to convert the csv files completely in to db file and then to create tables 
with python.

Inside of Starter code is where the html and main python files is, and the progress review.db file is directly export from the db brower that
I was using, if I can find a way to connect both of them, I think it will be the best way for me to continueing on this project, otherwise,
I will keep working on the transformation between csv and db in python.
